=======
Q 1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should        be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
     Hints: Consider use range(#begin, #end) method.

Code: 
nl=[]
for x in range(2000, 3200):
    if (x%7==0) and (x%5!=0):
        nl.append(str(x))
print (','.join(nl))
